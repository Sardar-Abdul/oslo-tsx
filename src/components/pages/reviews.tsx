                    I have been an illustrator for over 15 years now. This tool
                    allows me to manage multiple projects at once and it makes
                    my job way easier. Such a time saver.

                    I can now easily keep track of my team and all on-going
                    projects. No need to search through files and folders to see
                    who completed the task. It's great!

                    This tool is life changing! I can start organized and easily
                    coordinate schedules with my colleagues. I would highly
                    recommend this to anyone!
