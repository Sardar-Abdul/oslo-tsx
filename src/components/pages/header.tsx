              As the great Nelson Mandela said, “There is no passion to be found
              playing small — in settling for a life that is less than the one
              you are capable of living.” Powerful words from a man who left an
              incredible legacy. They challenge you and I to consider the all
              important question: “Am I living up to my full potential?”
